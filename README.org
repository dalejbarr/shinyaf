#+TITLE: Shiny Fast Feedback App

* Purpose

This Shiny web app was developed to allow students to provide rapid, anonymous, open-ended feedback to instructors on an ongoing course.

This app requires a shiny server, which you can install for free ([[https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/][details here]]).

* How it works

The app can host feedback for multiple courses. You interface to the app by passing 'tokens' in the HTTP request to the server. 

When you run the app for the first time, a secret 'course creation'
token is defined. Anyone with this token can make a new course.

When you create a course, you receive two URLs, one for students and one for staff. Students follow their URL to submit anonymous feedback. Staff follow theirs to view the feedback.

Staff can receive mobile notifications whenever new feedback has been submitted by associating a simplepush key with the course (visit https://www.simplepush.io/ for further information).  Mobile notifications will be sent with the tag 'feedback' to allow configuration.

** Create a course

When you follow the link to create a course, you will see this:

Just choose a name to describe your course. You can use any characters
you want, including spaces. Then enter your simplepush key (if you
have one, and want to get mobile notifications).

Once you submit this page, you'll get a page with links. Copy the
links and save them somewhere safe, where you won't lose them.

** What the student sees

When the student clicks the link you provide them, they see this.

** What the instructor sees

When you or another staff member clicks the staff link, you will see a
list of all the feedback, with the most recent at the top.

* Installation

Just download this repository and place the =feedback= subfolder with your shiny apps on your server.

The first time you run the app, two unique tokens are created, a *creator* token (for creating new courses) and a *reader* token, for viewing the feedback.  It will print the creator token on the screen. Store this token somewhere safe; you will need it each time you create a new course.

If you lose the creator token, you can only retrieve it from the SQLite database, which is stored in the same directory as the app; it is not possible to get it from the app. The creator token is stored in the table =tokens=.
